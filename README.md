# Automatic-Colorization-Using-Convolution-Neural-Networks-Graduation-Project-
Automatic Colorization for gray-scaled images without any human assistance. Based on the architecture of different classification pre-trained models as VGG16 &amp; Inception-ResNet-V2. A colorization model was developed with convolution Autoencoders to provide flexibility of image size to the model. The process of colorization was done according to the following steps:- 1- Convert color space for the gray-scaled image from RGB channel to LAB channel. 2- Separate L Channel away. 3- Pass image to the model architecture, encoder first then different convolution and pooling layers and finally decoder. 4- Model predict the AB channels which are responsible for color channels. 5- Merge L channel with the predicted AB channels to create colored output image.
